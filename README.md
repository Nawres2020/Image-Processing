**Image Processing**
This project focuses on Image Processing in Computer Vision, showcasing the first series of transformations applied to images. The Jupyter notebook included in this repository, Image_Processing.ipynb, demonstrates step-by-step implementation of these transformations, providing both the underlying code and visual examples.

Image Processing in Computer Vision
Image processing refers to a comprehensive set of techniques aimed at manipulating and analyzing digital images to extract meaningful information or enhance their visual quality. These techniques are essential in computer vision applications and include:

1. Image Transformation
Modifying or changing images through:

Geometric Transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation)
Fourier Transform (frequency domain analysis)
Intensity Transformations (e.g., brightness and contrast adjustments)
2. Image Enhancement
Improving the visual quality or clarity of images by highlighting critical features or minimizing noise and distortions. Techniques include:

Histogram Equalization
Contrast Enhancement
Image Sharpening
Color Correction
3. Noise Reduction Techniques
Removing unwanted noise while preserving essential details like edges and textures. Popular methods are:

Gaussian Smoothing
Median Filtering
Bilateral Filtering
Wavelet Denoising
4. Morphological Operations
Processing images based on their structure and shape to analyze regions or boundaries. Common operations are:

Erosion and Dilation
Opening and Closing
Morphological Gradient
These techniques form the foundation of modern computer vision, enabling tasks like object detection, image segmentation, and feature extraction.
